  The goal of this assignment is to provide you experience in developing and deploying a web application using AWS Cloud services. The web application would collect Twitts and do some processing and represent the Twitts on GoogleMaps. Following are the required steps:  
  
  1.Use Twitter Streaming API to fetch tweets from the twitter hose in real-time. Collect at least one week's worth of tweets. 
  
  2.Use AWS  ElasticSearch to store the tweets on the back-end.
  
  3.Create a web UI that allows users to search for a few keywords (via a dropdown). The keywords (up to 10) can be of your choosing.
  
  4.Use Google Maps API  (or any other mapping library) to render these filtered tweets in the map in whatever manner you want.

  5.Deploy your application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk  in an auto-scaling environment.

  6.Use ElasticSearch’s  geospatial feature that shows tweets that are within a certain distance from the point the user clicks on the map. 

  function on the web:
  1.select keyword and click search button: twitters contain keywords will be marked on the twitter map.
  2.select marker(click with right click):show a infowindow on the web which contains the content,date and author of the twitter.
  3.click map(click with left click): show twitters around the clicked point.
